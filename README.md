# Social Network Analysis Project  

## Overview  
This repository contains the project for the subject **Social Network Analysis**. The primary focus of this project is to analyze social network data by fetching and processing friends' data from Instagram using the `instaloader` library and visualizing the social network using `networkx` and `matplotlib`. Additionally, the project explores the diffusion of innovations in a phone calls network, focusing on influence maximization.  

## Project Structure  

### Unit 1: Basic exploration  
- Largest component of the network.  
- Centrality measure.
- Community detection.

### Unit 2: Diffusion of Innovations  
- Influence maximization in the phone calls network.  
- Independent cascade model for influence spread simulation.  

### Unit 3: Social Network Mapping  
- Data collection from Instagram.  
- Construction and visualization of a social network graph.  

## Installation  

To run the notebooks, install the following Python packages:  

```bash
pip install instaloader networkx matplotlib pandas tqdm
